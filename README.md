# MilkywayVR

This is a simulation/game project that I've been working on for a while. Eventually I hope to deploy it on a VR system without using any other game engines. It depens on too of my other projects:

* [HiveEngine](https://github.com/calper-ql/HiveEngine)
* [NGEN](https://github.com/calper-ql/NGEN)

This project uses OptiX bt Nvidia to raytrace visuals.

Here are some visuals:

First planet...

Planet surface was generated by a computation graph defined by [NGEN](https://github.com/calper-ql/NGEN)

As you get closer, HiveEngine checks and generates the planet, You virtually have no limit on how close you can get
