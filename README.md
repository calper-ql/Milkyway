# Milkyway

This is a simulation/game project that I've been working on for a while. Eventually I hope to deploy it on a VR system without using any other game engines. It depens on two of my other projects:

* [HiveEngine](https://github.com/calper-ql/HiveEngine)
* [NGEN](https://github.com/calper-ql/NGEN)

This project uses OptiX bt Nvidia to raytrace visuals.

Here are some visuals:

First planet...

Planet surface was generated by a computation graph defined by [NGEN](https://github.com/calper-ql/NGEN)

For now I have to abide by the native rules of NGEN, once I fully integrate I expect the surface generation to have much better performance. Right now, it runs on vsync at 165 on my desktop with an RTX card.

As you get closer, HiveEngine checks and generates the planet, You virtually have no limit on how close you can get
